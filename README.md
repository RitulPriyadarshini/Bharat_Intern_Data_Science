Task 1: The Titanic Classification

The Titanic Classification Project is an endeavor to utilize machine learning and data analysis techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history, and this project aims to shed light on the factors that influenced passenger survival. By analyzing historical data, we can build a model to predict whether a given passenger survived or perished.
The project consists of several key components, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction. It leverages a well-known dataset, the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset available on Kaggle, to perform these tasks. The dataset contains valuable information about passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, and other attributes, along with a binary indicator of whether they survived or not.

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values: Detect and address missing data, ensuring the dataset is clean and complete.
   - Encoding categorical features: Convert categorical attributes like gender and class into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
   - Feature selection: Choose relevant attributes that will contribute to the prediction task.

2. Model Selection:
   - Selection of an appropriate machine learning model for classification. Some common choices include Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

3. Model Training:
   - The selected model is trained using the cleaned and preprocessed training data. This step involves the learning of patterns and relationships within the data.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - The model's performance is assessed using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC).
   - The evaluation step helps determine how well the model is at predicting passenger survival.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Model hyperparameters are optimized to enhance its predictive accuracy. Techniques like grid search and cross-validation may be employed.

6. Prediction:
   - Once the model is trained and evaluated, it is utilized to make predictions on the test dataset. The goal is to predict whether passengers in the test dataset survived or not.

7. Output Generation:
   - The final predictions are generated and prepared in a format that is suitable for submission, typically in a CSV file that includes passenger IDs and survival predictions.

The Titanic Classification Project is a demonstration of how data science and machine learning can be applied to historical data to make predictions and gain insights. By analyzing the Titanic dataset, we aim to uncover the factors that influenced passenger survival and build a predictive model. This project is a testament to the power of data analysis and predictive modeling in uncovering valuable insights from historical events.




Task 2: Handwritten Digit Recognition with the MNIST Dataset

This project illustrates a Python script that employs a deep learning model to identify handwritten numbers. It makes use of the MNIST dataset for training and a pre-trained model to forecast the digits in images stored in a designated desktop folder. The code commences by loading and preparing the MNIST dataset, training a neural network model, and subsequently applying this model for digit prediction on images stored in the specified directory.

Import Essential Libraries:

- Utilize the 'os' library for file system operations.
- Employ 'cv2' for image processing.
- Utilize 'numpy' for numerical computations.
- Use 'matplotlib' for visualizing images.
- Rely on 'tensorflow' for machine learning and deep learning tasks.

Load and Preprocess the MNIST Dataset:

- Load the MNIST dataset, comprising images of handwritten digits paired with their labels.
- Normalize the pixel values of the images to fall within the 0 to 1 range, enhancing training efficiency.

Define a Neural Network Model:

- Create a Sequential model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Flatten the 28x28 pixel images into a 1D array.
- Include two dense layers with ReLU activation functions for feature extraction.
- Append the output layer with 10 units and use softmax activation for digit classification.
- Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.

Train the Model:

- Train the model utilizing the training data (x_train and y_train) over three epochs.
- The model acquires the ability to classify handwritten digits based on the training dataset.

Evaluate the Model:

- Assess the trained model's performance on the test data (x_test and y_test).
- Report the model's loss and accuracy on the test dataset.

Load and Predict on Desktop Images:

- Define the path to the folder containing digit images on the desktop.
- List all files in the folder with the ".png" extension.
- Iterate through the image files: Load each image using OpenCV and extract the first channel (assuming grayscale).
- Modify the image colors if necessary.
- Employ the trained model to predict the digit in the image.
- Display the image and the predicted digit using matplotlib.
- Handle any exceptions or errors that may arise during the process.

This code serves as a demonstration of the predictive capabilities of a neural network model trained on the MNIST dataset. It illustrates the steps involved in loading, preprocessing, and predicting digits from a designated folder using the pre-trained model.
